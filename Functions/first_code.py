#     # Functions
#      1. def to initiate/define a function
#      for example:
    
#      def <function-name()>:
#      def kilifi_function():

#  2. identation:
#  def kilifi_function():
#  <---->This is identation,and your code should be here
#        # This is also the body of the function
#        # result

#  # 3. Calling the function
#  # Outside the function, type the function name, with its curly braces
